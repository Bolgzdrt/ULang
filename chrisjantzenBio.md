## Project Sought

I would most like to work on a web development project utilizing cloud hosting platforms like AWS or Microsoft Azure and working with a full-stack web application. I really enjoy working on the front-end side of applications as well. I think creating an app with the purpose of educating would be a good base for this style of project. I am not rigid in this idea, however. I would be open to working on other interesting areas of computer science. Conversely, some areas that I would not be particularly interested in working on are low-level C/C++/Rust OS-level applications or robotics.
