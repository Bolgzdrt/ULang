## Project Description

ULang is an application for mastering foreign languages with practice tools and social vocabulary sharing to make studying simple and effective. It includes tools for learning to spell, pronounce and conjugate words. ULang is designed to be a supplemental learning tool for formal classes or any other source, making it ideal for users of all ages and stages of learning.

### Final

Together, we spent approximately 32 hours total meeting together to discuss individual progress, as well as completing the tasks assigned to us throughout the class.

#### Chris Messmer Summary

* First Semester - 44 hours
* Second Semester - 136 hours
* Total - 180

Justification

&emsp; 44 hours spent in the fist semester was composed of research and design, as well as completing biweekly assignments. Tasks in the first semester were primarily done as a group, and a breakdown of hours can be seen in the effort matrix above or within our midterm report.

&emsp; The second semester can be broken down into time spent in weekly meetings and time spent in deveopment. For each meeting we took a meeting minutes and recorded the time spent, these came to a total of 32 hours. These meetings included work time for all assignments, as well as UI mockup, planning, and scrum style collaborative work. For development time, over 10 weeks I spent roughly 2 days a week, 5 to 6 hours per day independently researching, coding, or otherwise working on ULang. Tasks during this time included implementing the sign up, log in, profile, edit set, and pronunciation practice pages, as well as implementing funcitonality to view and save sets belonging to other users.

#### Robert Bolgzds Summary

* First Semester - 46 hours
* Second Semester - 140 hours
* Total - 186 hours

Justification

&emsp;The first semester was spent planning, researching and designing, mostly as a team, which ended up being roughly 3 hours a week, along with completing the assignments given in class about the project. The breakdown of how the hours were divided in the first semester can be seen in our Midterm Effort Matrix above.

&emsp;The second semester was spent developing as well as completing assignments. As a group, we met almost weekly to discuss our progress on development and complete the assigned tasks for the class, totalling around 32 hours. In regards to time I spent individually working on the project, I did not keep a strict work schedule/log of the time, but I generally spent 3 or 4 days a week, for 10 weeks working. On average, I spent at least 10 or 11 hours a week, totalling to about 108 hours total development time for implementing the home, flash cards, vocabulary, conjugation practice, set creation, and word creation pages, as well as the sidebar.

#### Chris Jantzen Summary

* First Semester - 45 hours
* Second Semester - 152 hours
* Total - 197 hours

Justification

&emsp;We spent the first semester dividing up plans to research technologies and implementation strategies for our project along with completing class assignments. We did much of this work together as a team so that we would all be on the same page as we led into getting started working on building our application.

&emsp;For the second semester, we logged about 32 hours together in video call meetings completing assignments as well as doing weekly "scrum" style meetings that involved giving status updates and planning for the coming week by creating and assigning specific tasks that we created on a Trello task board. I worked on the development of the app about 3 to 4 days per week for a lower-end estimate of an average of 12 hours per week. We started development on January 15th, 2021, so there were 10 weeks for us to work on development. So my estimate is the 32 hours from our group meetings, plus an average of 12 hours per week for 10 weeks, totalling 192 hours.
