On the learn page you will be presented with a word from the set in the previously specified language. Type the translation into the input box below the word and click submit. For any words requring accented letters you can use the toolbar provided under the input box.

If the translated word is spelled correctly you will move on to the next word, if spelled incorrectly you can try again, or get the answer. You can skip a word at any time.

Once the set is finished, a results screen will appear to show how well you spelled the words in the set.
