# Conjugation

Select Conjugation from the side bar at the left side of the page.

Select from a list of your sets that contain verbs to practice. Sets without any verbs are not an option for this activity.

For each verb in the selected set, a conjugation table that was entered when adding the word will be displayed with one of the cells missing. Enter the missing conjugation in the textbox.

If the conjugation is entered correctly you will move on to the next word, if spelled incorrectly you can try again, or get the answer.

Once the set is finished, a results screen will appear to show how well you completed the tables in the set.
