## Project Area

ULang is a foreign language learning application focused on note keeping and practicing languages as you learn. It will feature verb conjugation tables to study all of the forms and tenses of verbs, customizable vocabulary sets, a section that will speak words or sentences of the language to the user and listen to the user speak it back to check for correct inflection and vocabulary, and more.
